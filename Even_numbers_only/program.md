# THE EVEN NUMBER ONLY PROGRAM

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ##Conditions

 >the program should have a for loop that iterates from 1 to 20
 >the program needs to use , if statment , with the "continue" keyowrd to skip printing odd numbers
 >all the even numbers are to be printed on a single line seprated by spaces

 so to make this i will first initialize the variables which are :

 *i = the number which will contain the integers
