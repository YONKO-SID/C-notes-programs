# HOMEWORK SOLUTIONS


## Description
This repository contains solutions to homework questions in my [c notes](https://github.com/YONKO-SID/C-notes).These codes may not be perfect or right but it's what I could come up with when learning c as my first langauge . You can do pull requests if you find mistakes in these . Many of the code files might have my comments in them so please don't mind them 😁.



## Usage

You can use these as refrence when you tried solving the homework questions but somehow where stuck .
