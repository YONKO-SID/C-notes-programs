# Gemini CLI Session Log

## Session Start: 2025-06-30

### User Goal
The user is a beginner C programmer looking for honest guidance to improve their logic, coding practices, and overall development skills. They want help with their "Even Numbers Only" project but have explicitly requested that I do not do the work for them.

### Project Context
- **Project:** Even Numbers Only
- **Directory:** `D:\back up 8oct 20\sublime projects\c projects\Even_numbers_only`
- **Files Read:** `README.md`, `program.md`, `main.c`
- **`main.c` status:** Contains `#include <stdio.h>` and an incomplete `main` function.

### Key Discussions
1.  **Guidance Style:** I agreed to act as an honest mentor, focusing on logic and best practices without writing the final code for the user.
2.  **Project Management:**
    - I recommended using Git for version control.
    - I strongly advised creating one repository per project, as this is the industry standard and promotes a clean, manageable history.
    - The user initially considered a single repository for all their C learning projects but was open to my suggestion.
3.  **Session Persistence:**
    - The user asked for a way to save our conversations to maintain context across different terminal sessions.
    - I proposed creating this `SESSION_LOG.md` file to serve as a record of our interactions. The user agreed.

### Next Steps
- The user is expected to start writing the code for the `main.c` file.
- I am waiting to review their code and provide feedback on their logic and implementation.
